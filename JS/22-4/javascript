javascript :

in html we write javascript in two different ways 
 1. internal script
 2. external script 

  1. internal script:   
  internal scripts are written from script tag.
  <script >
      js code 
  </script>

1. external script:   
  external scripts are written from  separate js file.
  File.js
 access (including) into html :
 <script src="File.js"></script>

Wrong Process :

<script ></script>  : first
<body></body>    : second
